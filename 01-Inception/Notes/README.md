# REACT JS

## Episode 1:

### 1. What is React?

### 2. What is the difference between library and frameworks?

- A **library** is a collection of pre-written code or functions that developers can call to solve specific problems. Ex- React, jQuery
- A **framework** is a complete structure with rules and guidelines where your code fits in to solve a problem. Ex- Angular
- With a **library**, the developer is in control and decides when to use it.
- With a **framework**, the framework controls the flow and calls your code when needed.

### 3. What is CDN?
