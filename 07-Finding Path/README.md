This episode focused heavily on Routing, one of the most important concepts in building seamless user experiences in React apps.
ðŸ”¹ Key Learnings:
âœ… SPA (Single Page Application) â€“ Only one HTML page loads; content updates dynamically using JavaScript. Fast, smooth experience just like Swiggy.
âœ… Client-Side vs Server-Side Routing â€“ Client-side is faster (used in SPAs), while server-side reloads full pages (better for SEO).
âœ… Ways to Add Images in React â€“
Import via ES6 modules
Use public folder
Remote URLs
Backgrounds in CSS
âœ… useState() Console Log â€“ Returns an array [state, updateFn]. Best used with destructuring.
âœ… useEffect() Variants:
No dependency array â†’ runs on every render
[] â†’ runs once after first render
[dependency] â†’ runs when dependency changes
